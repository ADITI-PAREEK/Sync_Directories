# Sync_Directories
This script synchronizes two directories.
It utilizes `rsync` for efficient synchronization, including the deletion of extraneous files in the destination or source directory.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the `sp.sh` script to your local machine.
2. Make executable using the following command: ```bash

                                                chmod +x sp.sh

3. Execute the script by providing the source the source and destination directories as arguments: ```bash

              ./sp.sh <source_directory> <destination_directory>
